Get lat long coordinates from list of properties

Came up with this to get the lat lngs out the City Of Ottawa
open data property Points.
http://data.ottawa.ca/en/dataset/address-points-main-and-subordinates

I have it set up to save to a MySql database right now.

You'll need to install MySQLdb to get this to work properly:

sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
pip install MySQL-python

Feel free to modify this for your use if you find it interesting.
